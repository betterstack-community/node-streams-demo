**Tutorial**: [Link to corresponding BetterStack tutorial]()

## ðŸŸ¢ Prerequisites

Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

- Clone this repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/betterstack-community/node-streams-demo
```

- `cd` into the project directory and execute the `node-streams.js` script:

```bash
node node-streams
```

You can also execute the `web-streams.js` script, which uses the Web Streams API:

```bash
node web-streams.js
```

**Note**: To execute the `read-files.js` script, make sure you run the `node-streams.js` or `web-streams.js` file first to create the `customer.log` file, which the script will read.
